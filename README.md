# sound-recording-wrapper.sh
Records sound from a single PulseAudio application to a file.
Look at the code, it's self-explaining.

See http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/322990/programmatically-redirect-audio-output-of-specific-program-to-file for discussion of the problem and maybe better solutions (not as of right now, but one can never know).
